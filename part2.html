            <h2>Battle Tendency</h2>
            <p>
                Battle Tendency follows the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, Joseph Joestar.
                Whereas Jonathan was chivalrous and followed the rules, Joseph is a rule
                breaker and is not afraid to fight dirty. The story follows Joseph and his
                friends as they travel across the world to defeat the Pillarmen, an ancient
                group of people with special powers, who created the mask that Dio used in part 1.
                It is a race to see who will obtain a relic first and whether or not the Pillarmen 
                will evolve into a greater threat to the world.
