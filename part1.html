            <h2>Phantom Blood</h2>
            <p>
                Phantom Blood is the first part of the series and the
                introduction to the Joestar family. It follows a young Jonathan Joestar,
                who believes in chivalry and good character, and his rival, Dio Brando,
                who wants to gain power for himself and making Jonathan's life miserable.
                When Dio finds a mask that turns him into a vampire, it is up to Jonathan
                to defeat him before he does harm to others. Despite being the shortest part,
                Phantom Blood lays the groundwork of the rest of the series, as future events
                can be tied back to this part.
