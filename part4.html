            <h2>Diamond is Unbreakable</h2>
            <p>
                Diamond is Unbreakable takes place in the a small but crazy
                town called Morioh. It follows Josuke Higashikata, Joseph's
                secret child in Japan. Although the town is normal on the surface,
                it secretly holds many people with abilities granted by a stand arrow, and a serial killer,
                who the people of the town must work together to stop. Despite facing many enemy stand users, 
                Josuke prefers to befriend them, rather than fighting them in order to have them contribute to 
                finding the town's murderer.
