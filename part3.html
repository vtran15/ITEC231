            <h2>Stardust Crusaders</h2>
            <p>
                Stardust Crusaders features the return of the antagonist from the part one, Dio.
                It is up to Joseph Joestar and his grandson, the new protagonist of this part,
                Jotaro Joestar. This part follows them and their crew as they travel from Japan
                to Egypt to save Jotaro's mother as she awakens a power that slowly kills her. With
                their new powers, called stands, they must defeat other stand users using their wits.
