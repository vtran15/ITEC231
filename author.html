            <h2>Hirohiko Araki</h2>
            <p>The genius behind the series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is Hirohiko Araki,
                a japanese manga artist. Araki is known for his striking art style that
                stands out from other series, as well as his style of writing, which is to
                develop the story as he goes, rather than planning out the story in advance.
            </p>

            <p>Araki was born in 1960 in Miyagi, Japan. Although he has worked other projects,
                he got his big break with Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in 1987. One of the things
                that makes Jojo's so unique is the change in genres between each part of the series.
                He is also known for naming many characters and abilities after song names or artists such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Pillarmen being named after "Cars," "AC/DC," and "Wham!"</li>
                <li>The main antagonist in part 4's stand is named "Killer Queen", after the song by Queen</li>
                <li>The main antagonist in part 5's stand is named "King Crimson," after the band</li>
                <li>Josuke's stand is named "Crazy Diamond." after a song by Pink Floyd</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Many authors since then have referenced his work, taking
                inspiration from Jojo's character personalities, the power systems, and even plotlines. Because of
                this, Araki is regarded as a major figure in anime and manga.</p>
