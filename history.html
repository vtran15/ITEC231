            <h2>Manga and Anime</h2>
            <p>The author, Araki initially published Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in 1987, and since then,
                has continued writing the series, even continuing the series today. Although there are
                nine total parts of the series, only six parts have been adapted into anime, and the
                latest to be adapted is a Netflix exclusive.
            </p>

            <p>The series was first adapted into anime in the 1993 version, which was an incomplete
                adaptation of part 3. Despite its popularity, Jojo's would not be fully adapted until
                many years later, in 2012, when the current version of the anime was released, which is
                considered more accurate and complete. It was after the 2012 anime version that the series
                blew up in popularity, sparking many memes and new audiences to start watching and reading
                the series.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Part 1 was written in 1987 and continued until 1988. The 2012 anime version adapted part 1 in 2012
                    and continued until 2013.</li>
                <li>Part 2 was written in 1987 and continued until 1989. The 2012 anime version adapted part 2 in 2012
                    and continued until 2013.</li>
                <li>Part 3 is the most popular part of the series. It was written in 1989 and continued until 1992. It
                    was first adapted into anime
                    in 1993, then later in the 2012 version, it was adapted in 2014 and continued until 2015.</li>
                <li>Part 4 was written in 1994 and continued until 1995. The 2012 anime version adapted part 4 in 2016
                    and continued until 2017.</li>
                <li>Part 5 was written in 1995 and continued until 1995. The 2012 anime version adapted part 5 in 2018
                    and continued until 2019.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Despite running since 1987, Araki continues to write the series to this day,
                adding more pop culture references and storylines to Jojo's. In total,
                there are nine parts, 3 of which have not been adapted yet. Parts 1 through
                5 are the only anime parts that are not Netflix exclusive.</p>
